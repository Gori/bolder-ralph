**Turn your brain dump into a PRD in 2 minutes.**

## What is Ralph?

Ralph is a CLI tool for developers and founders who have product ideas but hate writing specs. Describe what you want to build, and Ralph generates a structured PRD with features, user stories, and constraints — ready to hand off to development.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install && npm run build
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
node dist/source/cli.js
```

## How It Works

| Step | What You Do | What Ralph Does |
|:-----|:------------|:----------------|
| **Idea** | Describe your product in one sentence | — |
| **Details** | Brain dump everything else (audience, constraints, preferences) | — |
| **Define** | Pick or customize | Generates 3 options each for name, description, purpose, audience, product type |
| **Features** | Review, edit, delete, add | Generates feature list with descriptions and user stories |
| **Export** | Save | Outputs PRD in your chosen format |

## Output Formats

| Format | Flag | Use Case |
|:-------|:-----|:---------|
| Markdown | `--format=markdown` (default) | Human-readable docs, GitHub, Notion |
| JSON | `--format=json` | Programmatic access, integrations |
| [TOON](https://github.com/toon-format/toon) | `--format=toon` | Token-efficient LLM input |

```bash
node dist/source/cli.js                        # prd-output.md
node dist/source/cli.js --format=json          # prd-output.json
node dist/source/cli.js -o=my-product.md       # custom filename
```

## What's in a PRD?

Ralph generates PRDs focused on **what** and **why**, never **how**. Implementation details are the developer's job.

| Section | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Core definitions | Name, description, purpose, audience, product type |
| Features | Short name, description, purpose, user stories (as many as needed per feature) |
| Tech stack | Suggested technologies by category |
| Non-features | What the product explicitly won't do |
| Constraints | Hard limits and rules |
| Definition of done | Minimum viable outcome for v1 |

# FocusFlow

A desktop app that blocks distracting websites during work sessions.

**Purpose:** Help remote workers maintain focus by removing the temptation to visit time-wasting sites.

**Audience:** Remote workers and freelancers

**Product Type:** macOS menu bar app

---

## Features

### Block List
Users can specify which websites to block during focus sessions.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to add websites to my block list so that I can't access them during work
- As a user, I want to import a pre-made block list so that I don't have to manually add common distractions
- As a user, I want to remove sites from my block list so that I can adjust what's blocked

### Focus Sessions
Users can start timed focus sessions that activate blocking.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to start a 25-minute focus session so that I can work using the Pomodoro technique
- As a user, I want to set custom session lengths so that I can match my preferred work style
- As a user, I want to see how much time is left so that I know when my break is coming

---

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Electron
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Storage:** SQLite

## Non-Features
- No mobile app
- No team/enterprise features
- No browser extension

## Constraints
- macOS only for v1
- No account required
- All data stored locally

## Definition of Done
Users can create a block list, start a focus session, and be prevented from accessing blocked sites until the session ends.
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | required | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11` | Model to use for generation |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # watch mode
npm test         # prettier + xo + ava
```
