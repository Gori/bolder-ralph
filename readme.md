**Turn your brain dump into a PRD.**

Ralph is an interactive CLI tool that transforms your messy product ideas into clean, professional Product Requirements Documents. Just describe what you want to build, and Ralph guides you through defining it properly.

## Why Ralph?

You have an idea. Maybe it's scribbled on a napkin, maybe it's a wall of text in your notes app. Either way, turning that into something a developer can actually build is tedious.

Ralph does the heavy lifting:

- **Brain dump friendly** - Just describe your idea however it comes out
- **Smart suggestions** - AI generates options for names, descriptions, features
- **PM-quality output** - PRDs that focus on WHAT and WHY, trusting devs with HOW
- **Interactive refinement** - Edit, regenerate, or write your own for any field

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Set your OpenAI API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your key

# Run Ralph
node dist/source/cli.js
```

## How It Works

Ralph guides you through 5 steps:

1. **Idea** - "What do you want to build?" (one sentence)
2. **Details** - Brain dump everything else you know
3. **Define** - Pick or customize: name, description, purpose, audience, product type
4. **Features** - Review AI-generated features, edit/delete/add as needed
5. **Save** - Export your PRD as markdown

### Controls

| Key     | Action                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Enter` | Select / Submit              |
| `Esc`   | Continue / Submit multi-line |
| `↑` `↓` | Navigate options             |
| `←`     | Go back / Delete feature     |
| `→`     | Regenerate feature           |

## Example Output

Ralph generates PRDs like this:

```markdown
# ProductName

## Overview

A tool that helps developers write better documentation.

## Purpose

Documentation is often neglected because it's tedious to write.

## Audience

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable         | Description         | Default              |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | (required)           |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`   | Model to use        | `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11` |

### CLI Options

```
--output, -o  Output file path (default: prd-output.md)
```

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build
npm run build
```

## Philosophy

Ralph writes PRDs the way a great PM would:

- **WHAT and WHY, never HOW** - Features describe user outcomes, not implementation
- **Trust the developer** - No technical prescriptions, just clear requirements
- **Concise and clear** - No fluff, no filler, just the essentials
