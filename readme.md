You know that feeling when you have an amazing idea but turning it into something buildable feels like pulling teeth? Yeah. Ralph fixes that.

**Ralph turns your chaotic brain dump into a clean PRD in about 2 minutes.**

No templates. No forms. Just tell Ralph what you want to build, and he'll ask the right questions, suggest names and features, and spit out a proper product spec that any developer can run with.

## Get Started

**Option 1: Standalone executable (no Node.js required)**

```bash
npm install && npm run package:mac  # or package:linux, package:win
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
./bin/bolder-ralph
```

**Option 2: Run with Node.js**

```bash
npm install && npm run build
cp .env.example .env  # add your OpenAI key
node dist/source/cli.js
```

That's it. Ralph will take it from there.

## What Happens

1. **"What do you want to build?"** — One sentence. Don't overthink it.
2. **Brain dump** — Everything else. Tech preferences, audience, constraints, whatever.
3. **Define it** — Ralph suggests names, descriptions, audience. Pick one or write your own.
4. **Features** — AI-generated feature list. Edit, delete, regenerate, add more.
5. **Done** — Save your PRD and go build something.

## The Philosophy

Ralph writes PRDs like a PM who actually trusts their developers:

- **WHAT and WHY** — Never how. That's the dev's job.
- **No fluff** — Every word earns its place.
- **Outcomes over implementation** — Features describe what users can do, not how the code works.

## Config

| Variable         | Default              |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (required)           |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`   | `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11` |

```bash
node dist/source/cli.js --output=my-prd.md
```

## Dev

```bash
npm run dev    # watch mode
npm test       # prettier + xo + ava
```
