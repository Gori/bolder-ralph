Ok, let’s figure this out.

Let’s be a bit more structured. This is a major overhaul so you really need to carefully go through and build this. DO NOT MISS a single thing here.

We start off by asking a simple question - describing the actual concept. This is the first question, so it is:1. Intro, image of Ralph and our colorful logo (as it is now)
2. No “press anything to continue”, we go directly to the first question “What do you want to build?” - we ask for the main thing. “In one sentence, describe what you’re trying to do.”
3. Do you have anything more to add? This is where we go brain dump. User can add as much text as they want. They have to press enter to save each line - this is made clear.  The user can add anything they want, whether it’s more details about how it should work, how it should be built, audience, anything anything anything.
4. Based on these questions, we need to define some main things. These are:* Idea name
* Overall idea
* Purpose
* Audience
* Type of digital product (web, native app, cli tool, backend service, it could be anything)
These are the main five things we start with. They are shown as empty to start with, in four squares. Using AI, we generate three clear options for each, so the user is basically asked for each of these things. The user sees these three options, below each other, multiple choice style, plus a fourth option which is “Write your own”. The best one is the default, so the user only has to press enter to pick that one. 

Each of these are separate, and tell separate things. This means that there’s no purpose in the audience or type in the idea etc. Each are maximum two sentences long, as generated by the AI, not maximum written by the user.

5. After these four main things are asked, we generate features for this project. They are listed below each other. They both come from things the user said (we don’t forget anything they’ve said) and the whatever set of features needed to complete the users intent.

This is where we get into each thing to build, based on the platform we have. The features are first listed in a long list, with AI-generated short names + descriptions of what they are. The user can use their arrows to go up and down and enter to select-enter any of them. When one thing is selected, we open up to changing it, where we can edits its: short name, description but also its purpose and its user stories / goal. These are separate text fields. The user can in the list, also instead of pressing enter, press left (do you want to delete this, y or n) or right (recreate this from ai). At the bottom the user can also select to create a new feature. Here we have the same four text input fields, but after the user writes the first part, the others are generated through AI - which the user thence edit.

6. After the features, all of this is summarized according to our prd template. The user can now read through it and choose to go back (actually, in each step the user can go back and forward) or save it as a prd file. Then we’re done! Happy happy joy joy.

We’re colorful. We’re best-practice. We always let the user know we’re working, with great progress or status indicators. We have humor, but we’re minimal and clean. Our audience is people with no acceptance for bullshit or startup-jargon. We always use the best ink plugins possible for each part of the interface to do this.

This is never about monetization, exits, this is always just about creating the best product for the audience. That’s what we love. Building things. This should be part of everything.
